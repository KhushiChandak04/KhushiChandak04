# 👋 Hi, I’m @KhushiChandak04!

- 👀 I’m interested in coding and coffee (the only two C's I need in life).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to turn coffee into code and debugging my life.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve making the world a better place (or at least a bit more fun).
- 📫 How to reach me: Just send a carrier pigeon, but if that's too old-fashioned, try out my Email - khushichandak2005@gmail.com, if only you are lucky to get reply!! pun intended ;)
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once tried to teach my dog how to code, but he just kept chasing the cursor. 🐶💻
